Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.   Certain funds may have contractual or voluntary fee waivers that result in a Net Expense Ratio. For additional fee information, please click on the fund name above.   This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read and consider it carefully before investing. To view a prospectus for an iShares ETF, please use the following link: https://www.ishares.com/us/library/financial-legal-tax. To view a prospectus for an iShares Index Mutual Fund, please use the following link: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents/mutual-funds   Investing involves risk, including loss of principal.   Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Any applicable brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Beginning August 10, 2020, market price returns for BlackRock and iShares ETFs are calculated using the closing price and account for distributions from the fund. Prior to August 10, 2020, market price returns for BlackRock and iShares ETFs were calculated using the midpoint price and accounted for distributions from the fund. The midpoint is the average of the bid/ask prices at 4:00 PM ET (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs). The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.   Performance shown may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers.   Inclusion of Sustainability Characteristics is not indicative of a fund’s investment objective, nor is it an implication that a fund employs an ESG-related portfolio management strategy. For newly launched funds, Sustainability Characteristics are typically available 6 months after launch. To be included in MSCI ESG Fund Ratings, 65% of the fund’s gross weight must come from securities covered by MSCI ESG Research (certain cash positions and other asset types deemed not relevant for ESG analysis by MSCI are removed prior to calculating a fund’s gross weight; the absolute values of short positions are included but treated as uncovered), the fund’s holdings date must be less than one year old, and the fund must have at least ten securities.

The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.    30-Day SEC Yield: A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund's expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund. Negative 30-Day SEC Yield results when accrued expenses of the past 30 days exceed the income collected during the past 30 days.   Incept (%): For index mutual funds, since inception performance is included only for funds with less than ten years of performance history. For exchange-traded funds, since inception performance is always included.    Unsubsidized 30-day Sec Yield (%) : Represents what a fund's 30-Day SEC Yield would have been had no fee waiver or expense reimbursement been in place over the period.   Duration: Effective duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.   YTD Return (%):  YTD (year to date) is a period, starting from the beginning of the current calendar year, and continuing up to the present day.    Option Adjusted Spread : The weighted average incremental yield earned over similar duration US Treasuries, measured in basis points. This metric considers the likelihood that bonds will be called or prepaid before the scheduled maturity date.    Avg Yield (%): The discount rate that equates the present value of a bond’s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average Yield to Maturity is the weighted average of the fund’s individual bond holding yields based on Net Asset Value (‘NAV’). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, this yield is the yield-to-worst.   MSCI ESG Quality Score : The MSCI ESG Quality Score (0 - 10) for funds is calculated using the weighted average of the ESG scores of fund holdings. The Score also considers ESG Rating trend of holdings and the fund exposure to holdings in the laggard category. MSCI rates underlying holdings according to their exposure to 37 industry specific ESG risks and their ability to manage those risks relative to peers. These issuer-level ESG ratings correspond to an issuer-level ESG Score.    MSCI ESG Rating : The MSCI ESG Rating for funds is designed to measure the resiliency of portfolios to long-term ESG risks and opportunities. The most highly rated funds consist of issuers with leading or improving management of key ESG risks. The ESG Rating is calculated as a direct mapping of ESG Quality Scores to letter rating categories (e.g. AAA = 8.6-10). The ESG Ratings range from leader (AAA, AA), average (A, BBB, BB) to laggard (B, CCC).   MSCI Weighted Carbon Average : (Tons CO2E/$M SALES) The MSCI Weighted Average Carbon Intensity measures a fund's exposure to carbon intensive companies. This figure represents the estimated greenhouse gas emissions per $1 million in sales across the fund’s holdings. The figure is a sum of the normalized security weight multiplied by the security Carbon Intensity. This allows for comparisons between funds of different sizes.   MSCI ESG Coverage : Percent by weight of a fund's holdings that have ESG Data.   As of (Based on holdings as of) : Sustainability Characteristics data is from MSCI ESG Fund Ratings as of the first date displayed, based on holdings as of the second date displayed in parentheses.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
