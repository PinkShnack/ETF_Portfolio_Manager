<p><strong>Risk Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Investment Risks</p>
<p>iShares products may not be suitable for all investors and BlackRock does not guarantee the performance of the iShares products. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. The value and price of securities (which may trade in limited markets) of the iShares products and the income from them may fall as well as rise and an investor may not recover the full amount invested. An investor’s income from iShares products is not necessarily fixed and may fluctuate. Where an investor invests in an iShares product denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the investor is resident, the return to the investor may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>Exchange rate movements can affect the value of investments involving exposure to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Any projections or examples (including calculations used therein) set out in this website are for illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete or up to date.</p>
<p>Tax levels, the tax status of the iShares products, the taxation of investors and any tax reliefs may change from time to time. Any change in the taxation legislation in any jurisdiction where an iShares product is registered, cross-listed, marketed or invested could affect the tax status of the iShares product, affect the value of the relevant iShares product’s investments in the affected jurisdiction, affect the relevant iShares product’s ability to achieve its investment objective, and/or alter the post tax returns to investors. The availability and value of any tax reliefs available to investors depend on the individual circumstances of investors. Any tax-related information in this website is not exhaustive and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to their particular tax situations and the tax effects of an investment in the iShares products.</p>
<p>Important information about iShares products is contained in the relevant prospectuses of the iShares products, copies of which can be obtained on this website or from your broker or financial adviser. Please refer to the iShares products’ prospectuses for a full description of the risks of investing in the products.<br />Securities of iShares products may be purchased or sold throughout the day on one or more stock exchanges (secondary market) through an authorised intermediary. Securities of iShares products may only be subscribed or redeemed directly with the relevant iShares product (primary market) by authorised participants in very large creation / redemption sizes.</p>
<p>When making an investment in an iShares product, you are buying securities issued by a company that will be listed on one or more stock exchanges. The price of the securities will be determined by supply and demand. Such price will not necessarily be the same as the value per security of that iShares product’s assets. At any time the security price may be at a discount or premium to the asset value. However, because of the exchange traded structure, it is expected that a significant discount or premium of price to asset value will not be sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Affiliated companies of BAUL may make markets in the securities of the iShares products. Further, BlackRock, its employees and other funds managed by BlackRock may from time to time acquire or hold securities or holdings in the underlying securities of, or options on, any security of the iShares products and may as principal or agent buy or sell securities.</p>
<p>In respect of the iShares Products mentioned herein, they are intended for information purposes only and do not constitute investment advice or a personal recommendation or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these iShares products.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</p>
<p>The capital return and income of each iShares fund are based on the capital appreciation and income on the securities it holds, less expenses incurred. Therefore, each iShares fund’s return may be expected to fluctuate in response to changes in such capital appreciation or income. Additionally, the securities in an equity benchmark index may under-perform fixed income investments and stock market investments that track other markets, segments or sectors different to that of an iShares fund. As foreign exchanges can be open on days when shares in an iShares fund are not priced, the value of the securities in an iShares fund’s portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell an iShares fund’s shares.</p>
<p>Certain iShares funds may use derivatives, details of which will be set out in the relevant prospectuses. The use of derivatives involves special risks and the iShares funds may be exposed to credit risk with regard to parties with whom it trades.</p>
<p>An investment in an iShares fund often involves investing in international markets. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments involve the risk of losing all or part of any capital from unfavourable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. The value of investments in iShares funds investing in economies and markets which may be less developed than more established economies (including emerging markets), may be subject to greater volatility due to increased uncertainty as to how these markets operate and the possibility of lower trading volumes.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs)</p>
<p>iShares Physical ETCs are exchange traded commodities and are neither fund nor exchange traded funds. The iShares Physical ETCs are series of secured metal-linked securities issued in the form of debt securities. Unlike the iShares funds domiciled in Ireland which issue shares, the securities of all iShares Physical ETCs are issued in the form of debt securities which are listed and traded as non-equity securities.</p>
<p>Precious metal prices are generally more volatile than most other asset classes, making investment riskier and more complex than other investments. In addition, iShares Physical ETCs are limited recourse obligations which are payable solely out of the underlying secured property. If the secured property is insufficient, any outstanding claims will remain unpaid.</p>

<p>Specifically, the securities of the iShares products domiciled in Ireland, Germany Switzerland and Luxembourg have not been, and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 of the USA (the “1933 Act”) or the securities laws of any of the states of the United States. Such securities may not be offered or sold directly or indirectly in the United States or for the account or benefit of any US Person, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to the regulatory requirement of the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws. Any re-offer or resale of any of the securities in the United States or to US Persons may constitute a violation of US law. “US Person” means any person or entity deemed by the US Securities Exchange Commission from time to time to be a “U.S. Person” under Rule 902(k) of the 1933 Act or other person or entity as the directors of the iShares Products (or their umbrella companies or managers) may determine.

<p><strong>Risk Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Investment Risks</p>
<p>iShares products may not be suitable for all investors and BlackRock does not guarantee the performance of the iShares products. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. The value and price of securities (which may trade in limited markets) of the iShares products and the income from them may fall as well as rise and an investor may not recover the full amount invested. An investor’s income from iShares products is not necessarily fixed and may fluctuate. Where an investor invests in an iShares product denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the investor is resident, the return to the investor may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>Exchange rate movements can affect the value of investments involving exposure to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Any projections or examples (including calculations used therein) set out in this website are for illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete or up to date.</p>
<p>Tax levels, the tax status of the iShares products, the taxation of investors and any tax reliefs may change from time to time. Any change in the taxation legislation in any jurisdiction where an iShares product is registered, cross-listed, marketed or invested could affect the tax status of the iShares product, affect the value of the relevant iShares product’s investments in the affected jurisdiction, affect the relevant iShares product’s ability to achieve its investment objective, and/or alter the post tax returns to investors. The availability and value of any tax reliefs available to investors depend on the individual circumstances of investors. Any tax-related information in this website is not exhaustive and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to their particular tax situations and the tax effects of an investment in the iShares products.</p>
<p>Important information about iShares products is contained in the relevant prospectuses of the iShares products, copies of which can be obtained on this website or from your broker or financial adviser. Please refer to the iShares products’ prospectuses for a full description of the risks of investing in the products.<br />Securities of iShares products may be purchased or sold throughout the day on one or more stock exchanges (secondary market) through an authorised intermediary. Securities of iShares products may only be subscribed or redeemed directly with the relevant iShares product (primary market) by authorised participants in very large creation / redemption sizes.</p>
<p>When making an investment in an iShares product, you are buying securities issued by a company that will be listed on one or more stock exchanges. The price of the securities will be determined by supply and demand. Such price will not necessarily be the same as the value per security of that iShares product’s assets. At any time the security price may be at a discount or premium to the asset value. However, because of the exchange traded structure, it is expected that a significant discount or premium of price to asset value will not be sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Affiliated companies of BAUL may make markets in the securities of the iShares products. Further, BlackRock, its employees and other funds managed by BlackRock may from time to time acquire or hold securities or holdings in the underlying securities of, or options on, any security of the iShares products and may as principal or agent buy or sell securities.</p>
<p>In respect of the iShares Products mentioned herein, they are intended for information purposes only and do not constitute investment advice or a personal recommendation or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these iShares products.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</p>
<p>The capital return and income of each iShares fund are based on the capital appreciation and income on the securities it holds, less expenses incurred. Therefore, each iShares fund’s return may be expected to fluctuate in response to changes in such capital appreciation or income. Additionally, the securities in an equity benchmark index may under-perform fixed income investments and stock market investments that track other markets, segments or sectors different to that of an iShares fund. As foreign exchanges can be open on days when shares in an iShares fund are not priced, the value of the securities in an iShares fund’s portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell an iShares fund’s shares.</p>
<p>Certain iShares funds may use derivatives, details of which will be set out in the relevant prospectuses. The use of derivatives involves special risks and the iShares funds may be exposed to credit risk with regard to parties with whom it trades.</p>
<p>An investment in an iShares fund often involves investing in international markets. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments involve the risk of losing all or part of any capital from unfavourable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. The value of investments in iShares funds investing in economies and markets which may be less developed than more established economies (including emerging markets), may be subject to greater volatility due to increased uncertainty as to how these markets operate and the possibility of lower trading volumes.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs)</p>
<p>iShares Physical ETCs are exchange traded commodities and are neither fund nor exchange traded funds. The iShares Physical ETCs are series of secured metal-linked securities issued in the form of debt securities. Unlike the iShares funds domiciled in Ireland which issue shares, the securities of all iShares Physical ETCs are issued in the form of debt securities which are listed and traded as non-equity securities.</p>
<p>Precious metal prices are generally more volatile than most other asset classes, making investment riskier and more complex than other investments. In addition, iShares Physical ETCs are limited recourse obligations which are payable solely out of the underlying secured property. If the secured property is insufficient, any outstanding claims will remain unpaid.</p>
<p>Investment Advice</p>
<p>The content of this website is general in nature and is meant to inform investors, potential investors and their professional intermediaries of the existence of, and potential benefits of investing in, iShares products. However, this website is not intended to provide specific investment advice including, without limitation, investment, financial, legal, accounting or tax advice, or to make any recommendations (personal recommendations or otherwise) about the suitability of iShares products for the circumstances of any particular investor. If you do require investment advice, please contact an independent broker or financial adviser. You should take appropriate advice as to any securities, taxation or other legislation affecting you personally prior to investing.</p>

<p>Specifically, the securities of the iShares products domiciled in Ireland, Germany Switzerland and Luxembourg have not been, and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 of the USA (the “1933 Act”) or the securities laws of any of the states of the United States. Such securities may not be offered or sold directly or indirectly in the United States or for the account or benefit of any US Person, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to the regulatory requirement of the 1933 Act and any applicable state securities laws. Any re-offer or resale of any of the securities in the United States or to US Persons may constitute a violation of US law. “US Person” means any person or entity deemed by the US Securities Exchange Commission from time to time to be a “U.S. Person” under Rule 902(k) of the 1933 Act or other person or entity as the directors of the iShares Products (or their umbrella companies or managers) may determine.

<p><strong>Risk Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Investment Risks</p>
<p>iShares products may not be suitable for all investors and BlackRock does not guarantee the performance of the iShares products. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. The value and price of securities (which may trade in limited markets) of the iShares products and the income from them may fall as well as rise and an investor may not recover the full amount invested. An investor’s income from iShares products is not necessarily fixed and may fluctuate. Where an investor invests in an iShares product denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the investor is resident, the return to the investor may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>Exchange rate movements can affect the value of investments involving exposure to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Any projections or examples (including calculations used therein) set out in this website are for illustrative purposes only and are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete or up to date.</p>
<p>Tax levels, the tax status of the iShares products, the taxation of investors and any tax reliefs may change from time to time. Any change in the taxation legislation in any jurisdiction where an iShares product is registered, cross-listed, marketed or invested could affect the tax status of the iShares product, affect the value of the relevant iShares product’s investments in the affected jurisdiction, affect the relevant iShares product’s ability to achieve its investment objective, and/or alter the post tax returns to investors. The availability and value of any tax reliefs available to investors depend on the individual circumstances of investors. Any tax-related information in this website is not exhaustive and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to their particular tax situations and the tax effects of an investment in the iShares products.</p>
<p>Important information about iShares products is contained in the relevant prospectuses of the iShares products, copies of which can be obtained on this website or from your broker or financial adviser. Please refer to the iShares products’ prospectuses for a full description of the risks of investing in the products.<br />Securities of iShares products may be purchased or sold throughout the day on one or more stock exchanges (secondary market) through an authorised intermediary. Securities of iShares products may only be subscribed or redeemed directly with the relevant iShares product (primary market) by authorised participants in very large creation / redemption sizes.</p>
<p>When making an investment in an iShares product, you are buying securities issued by a company that will be listed on one or more stock exchanges. The price of the securities will be determined by supply and demand. Such price will not necessarily be the same as the value per security of that iShares product’s assets. At any time the security price may be at a discount or premium to the asset value. However, because of the exchange traded structure, it is expected that a significant discount or premium of price to asset value will not be sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>Affiliated companies of BAUL may make markets in the securities of the iShares products. Further, BlackRock, its employees and other funds managed by BlackRock may from time to time acquire or hold securities or holdings in the underlying securities of, or options on, any security of the iShares products and may as principal or agent buy or sell securities.</p>
<p>In respect of the iShares Products mentioned herein, they are intended for information purposes only and do not constitute investment advice or a personal recommendation or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these iShares products.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</p>
<p>The capital return and income of each iShares fund are based on the capital appreciation and income on the securities it holds, less expenses incurred. Therefore, each iShares fund’s return may be expected to fluctuate in response to changes in such capital appreciation or income. Additionally, the securities in an equity benchmark index may under-perform fixed income investments and stock market investments that track other markets, segments or sectors different to that of an iShares fund. As foreign exchanges can be open on days when shares in an iShares fund are not priced, the value of the securities in an iShares fund’s portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell an iShares fund’s shares.</p>
<p>Certain iShares funds may use derivatives, details of which will be set out in the relevant prospectuses. The use of derivatives involves special risks and the iShares funds may be exposed to credit risk with regard to parties with whom it trades.</p>
<p>An investment in an iShares fund often involves investing in international markets. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments involve the risk of losing all or part of any capital from unfavourable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. The value of investments in iShares funds investing in economies and markets which may be less developed than more established economies (including emerging markets), may be subject to greater volatility due to increased uncertainty as to how these markets operate and the possibility of lower trading volumes.</p>
<p>Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs)</p>
<p>iShares Physical ETCs are exchange traded commodities and are neither fund nor exchange traded funds. The iShares Physical ETCs are series of secured metal-linked securities issued in the form of debt securities. Unlike the iShares funds domiciled in Ireland which issue shares, the securities of all iShares Physical ETCs are issued in the form of debt securities which are listed and traded as non-equity securities.</p>
<p>Precious metal prices are generally more volatile than most other asset classes, making investment riskier and more complex than other investments. In addition, iShares Physical ETCs are limited recourse obligations which are payable solely out of the underlying secured property. If the secured property is insufficient, any outstanding claims will remain unpaid.</p>
<p>Investment Advice</p>
<p>The content of this website is general in nature and is meant to inform investors, potential investors and their professional intermediaries of the existence of, and potential benefits of investing in, iShares products. However, this website is not intended to provide specific investment advice including, without limitation, investment, financial, legal, accounting or tax advice, or to make any recommendations (personal recommendations or otherwise) about the suitability of iShares products for the circumstances of any particular investor. If you do require investment advice, please contact an independent broker or financial adviser. You should take appropriate advice as to any securities, taxation or other legislation affecting you personally prior to investing.</p>
